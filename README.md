CreativeCity - A Geo-Contextual Augmented reality Application For Android
============

MSc Project ~ University College Cork- Oct 2013
============

Based on a locationally and contextually aware system. It aims to combine both methods of augmented reality allowing for area information or content to be registered to a specific place of interest.
The main features of the project are the location based methods, user location, point of interest location and the set proximity alerts. Along, with the vision based tracking and registration of content.
In order to implement these systems, the Androids Location Manager system was instigated to obtain geolocational information and the Vuforia AR software package was used for content creation and registration.

This application has Cork City Locations as its assets, and video and 3d images (converted using perl).
To create your own creative city you will need to creat your own Vuforia account, with images of location Images, download the file and replace.
